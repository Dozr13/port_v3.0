// Having a defined color palette is a great starting point for creating a visually appealing portfolio. When trying to attract future employers, it's not just about using eye-catching colors but also about employing them in a way that adds to the user experience and showcases your skills. Here's how you can use your color palette effectively:

// Text & Typography
// Use PRIMARY_COLOR for headings to grab attention.
// Use SECONDARY_COLOR for sub-headings or highlighted text.
// Use BACKGROUND_COLOR or a lighter/darker shade for the main body text for better readability.
// Backgrounds
// Use BACKGROUND_COLOR as the main background color for your site, since it's the darkest and will offer a nice contrast.
// Use SECONDARY_BACKGROUND_COLOR for card backgrounds or sections that need to stand out but not overpower the primary content.
// Buttons and Call to Actions
// Use PRIMARY_COLOR for primary action buttons, like "Contact Me" or "View Project".
// Use SECONDARY_COLOR for secondary actions or hover states.
// Links and Highlights
// MID_GROUND_COLOR could be used for links or to highlight selected navigation items.
// Borders and Shadows
// Use lighter or darker shades of your primary and secondary colors for borders or box-shadows to maintain uniformity.
// Visualizations & Graphs
// If you have any graphs or visualizations, try to use all the colors in your palette to represent different datasets.
// Eye-Catching Sections
// For sections that you want to emphasize, like an award or special project, use a combination of PRIMARY_COLOR and SECONDARY_COLOR.
